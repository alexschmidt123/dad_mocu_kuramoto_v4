# Description
This script, developed by NREL, implements an inertia estimation algorithm using a sliding window approach.
The inertia (H) is estimated based on frequency deviations and active power deviations, utilizing the swing
equation from power system dynamics. An example application is provided using the WECC 240-bus system.
