Description:
    This script, developed by NREL, implements an inertia estimation algorithm using a sliding window approach.
    The inertia (H) is estimated based on frequency deviations and active power deviations, utilizing the swing
    equation from power system dynamics. An example application is provided using the WECC 240-bus system,
    as described in the following reference:

Disclaimer: 
    This Opensource inertia estimation tool is developed based on ambient data from simulations of simplified WECC 240-bus system. 
    Application to  real-world power system data requires further modifications and calibrations based on the grid and operating conditions.

    """
    Estimate the equivalent inertia H using a sliding window approach.

    The algorithm divides the time-series data into overlapping windows. For each window,
    a linear regression (first-order polynomial fit) is applied to the frequency deviation
    data to estimate the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF). Then, using the swing equation,
    an equivalent inertia H is estimated with the formula:

        ROCOF = DeltaP / (2 * H)   =>   H = DeltaP / (2 * ROCOF)

    Parameters:
      frequency_dev : array-like
          The COI frequency deviation of one area.
      power_dev : array-like
          The average active power deviation of one area.
      dt : float
          Sample time interval (seconds).
      window_size : float
          Length of the sliding window in seconds (default: 0.3 s).
      step_size : float
          Step (shift) in seconds between consecutive windows (default: 0.1 s).

    Returns:
      t_centers : np.ndarray
          Array of center times for each sliding window.
      H_est : np.ndarray
          Array of estimated equivalent inertia values for each window.
